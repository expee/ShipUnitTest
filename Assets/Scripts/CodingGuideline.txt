This is the coding guideline for ShipUnitTest project

<varName>   = used for public variables
m_<varName> = used for private member variables in a class
l_<varName> = used for local variable in a functions/methods (l_ stands for "local")
s_<varName> = used for static variables

always use PascalCasing for Methods name (ex: MethodName)
always use camelCasing for variables name (ex: variableName)

always use UPPERCASE for DEFINES and ENUMS
